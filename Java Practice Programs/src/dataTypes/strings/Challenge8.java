/*
    Write a class called MyRegex which will contain a string pattern.
    You need to write a regular expression and assign it to the pattern
    such that it can be used to validate an IP address.

    Use the following definition of an IP address:
    IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", where the value of A, B, C, and D may
    range from 0 to 255. Leading zeros are allowed. The length of A, B, C, or D can't be greater than 3.

    In this problem you will be provided strings containing any combination of ASCII characters.
    You have to write a regular expression to find the valid IPs.

    Just write the MyRegex class which contains a String pattern.
    The string should contain the correct regular expression.
    (MyRegex class MUST NOT be public)
